    "# Intro\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement your own image recognition system for classifying digits. Read through the code and the instructions carefully and add your own code where indicated. Each problem can be addressed succinctly with the included packages -- please don't add any more. \n",
    "As always, you're welcome to work on the project in groups and discuss ideas over Slack, but <b> please prepare your own write-up (with your own code). </b> To be safe, please credit any sources used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "---\n",
    " - Make sure to answer every part in every question.\n",
    " - There are 5 questions, each worth an equal number of points.\n",
    " - Read carefully what is asked including the notes.\n",
    " - Additional points may be deducted if:\n",
    "   - the code is not clean or is not well commented\n",
    "   - the functions or answers are excessively long\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "---\n",
    "1. Comment your code.\n",
    "1. Each graph should have a title, labels for each axis, and (if needed) a legend. Each graph should be understandable on its own.\n",
    "1. All code must run on colab.research.google.com\n",
    "1. You should not import any additional libraries.\n",
    "1. Try and minimize the use of the global namespace (meaning, keep things inside functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional reading and notes\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking to get started with Tensorflow, you can read through this tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification. It uses a dataset called \"fashion_mnist\", which is identical in structure to the original digit mnist, but uses images of clothing rather than images of digits. The number of training examples and number of labels is the same. In fact, you can simply replace the code that loads \"fashion_mnist\" with \"mnist\" and everything should work fine.\n",
