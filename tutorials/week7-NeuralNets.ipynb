    "In this notebook we will be revisiting the problem of digit classification on the MNIST data.  In doing so, we will introduce a new Python library, Theano, for working with neural networks.  Theano is a popular choice for neural networks as the same code can be run on either CPUs or GPUs.  GPUs greatly speed up the training and prediction, and is readily available. Amazon offers GPU machines on EC2.  \n",

In part 2, we'll create a multi-layer neural network with a simple architechure, and train it using backpropagation.  Part 3 will introduce the convolutional architechure, which can be said to be doing 'deep learning' (also called feature learning or representation learning)."

    "Let's look at a recent idea around activation closely associated with deep learning.  In 2010, in a paper published at NIPS (https://www.utc.fr/~bordesan/dokuwiki/_media/en/glorot10nipsworkshop.pdf), Yoshua Bengio showed that rectifier activation works better empirically than sigmoid activation when used in the hidden layers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The rectifier activation is simple: f(x)=max(0,x).  Intuitively, the difference is that as a sigmoid activated node approaches 1 it stops learning even if error continues to be propagated to it, whereas the rectifier activated node continue to learn (at least in the positive direction).  It is not completely understood (per Yoshua Bengio) why this helps, but there are some theories being explored including as related to the benefits of sparse representations in networks. (http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/talks/KDD2014-tutorial.pdf).  Rectifiers also speed up training.\n",

Let's try that again here, however this time with a trick for adding noise called 'Dropouts'.  The idea with dropouts is that instead of (or in addition to) adding noise to our inputs, we add noise by having each node return 0 with a certain probability during training.  This trick both improves generalization in large networks and speeds up training.\n",
